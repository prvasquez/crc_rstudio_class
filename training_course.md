### Rstudio vs R
Rstudio is a **GUI** (Graphical User Interface). This software allow the us to easily visualize the information we are working with.

R is a **programming language**. Whenever we run code, we will be using the language R.

### Opening Rstudio
Go ahead and open the Rstudio application.

After opening go to File > New File > R Script (Keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+shift+N). This will open an additional box in the top left corner of your Rstudio screen.

1. Your R script that you are making. This box can serve multiple purposes, one can be to copy and paste the commands you wrote so that you don't forget them.
2. Your global environment. This box will show the data that is currently stored in your Rstudio session, an example would be a global variable.
3. Your command console. This is where you can write in code to run. You will use this a lot.
4. Files, plots, packages, etc. This is the miscellaneous box. It has a little bit of everything but we won't worry bout it too much today.
